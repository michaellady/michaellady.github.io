I"<p>Jiu-jitsu and life in general is going to have an interesting “reset” after this quarantine. There’s going to be people who took advantage of the time they were given, and those who didn’t. I’m treating every day like an opportunity to get an edge on my opponents. About one month in, I’m approximately the same weight, 230 lbs, but there is a definite difference in my strength levels and I’m looking a little leaner, indicating some muscle gain and fat loss. This is honestly pretty good for a body recomposition goal.</p>
