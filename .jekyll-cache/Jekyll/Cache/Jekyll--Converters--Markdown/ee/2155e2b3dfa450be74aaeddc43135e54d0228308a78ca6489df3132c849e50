I"±<p>Only about a week back did I decide to try to write every morning. The words flow easier right when I get up. Itâ€™s a nice little ritual where I go and make my coffee and sit down at the counter with my laptop and start getting my ideas out. Itâ€™s a nice, cozy way to mentally â€œwarm upâ€ for the day, kind of like when we all show up at 6am jiu-jitsu class and shoot the shit for 15-20 mins before any jiu-jitsu happens.</p>
