I"É<p>Only about a week back did I decide to try to write every morning. The words flow easier right when I get up. Itâ€™s a nice little ritual where I go and make my coffee and sit down at the counter with my laptop and start getting my ideas out. Itâ€™s a nice, cozy way to mentally â€œwarm upâ€ for the day, kind of like when we all show up at 6am jiu-jitsu class and shoot the shit for 15-20 mins before any jiu-jitsu happens.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s also this weird desire that Iâ€™ve had over the last couple of years to put more content out. Iâ€™ve been mostly quiet on social media before then, occasionally posting when something important happens. I basically post every day now. I think it comes from a desire to share and pass on my ideas, and a bit of social validation. I think my ideas are good. Hell, theyâ€™ve gotten me this far so they must be, but it helps to confirm that Iâ€™m not crazy, and that people get value from the content I post.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s this idea from Richard Dawkins of â€œmemesâ€ (before they were internet jokes), where ideas have a kind of â€œDNAâ€ and their own process of natural selection. Adaptive ideas are passed on to the next generation, and maladaptive ones are discarded. The first draft of the previous sentence had â€œgoodâ€ and â€œbadâ€, but then I remembered my biology classes. In that biologically-driven way, I want to put more of my ideas out into the world, to pass on the knowledge to others, and leave my mark in society as a force for â€œgoodâ€. Given the previous discussion on adaptive vs. maladaptive, I want to help the human race continue with adaptive ideas that enable people to live their best, fulfilled lives. Thatâ€™s the ultimate <a href="/dev/2017/11/21/On-Being-A-Support-Hero.html">â€œforce multiplierâ€</a> that I can be.</p>

<p>Largely without religion, this generation and upcoming ones have to create their own purpose in the world. I found mine through physical and mental grappling, and that was over the course of iterating and meandering through a lot of different things. I didnâ€™t get it right the first try, or the second, or even the fourth. Most people donâ€™t even want to start to try to move in a direction for fear of being wrong, and just accept whatever direction they are already going in. Even if you change and go in the wrong direction, youâ€™ll at least know <em>why</em> that was the wrong direction, and you will be able to course-correct for the next change.</p>

<p>One of the phrases that annoyed me most when I was graduating college and had a job offer in hand already was that I was â€œsetâ€. I was just beginning! What was â€œsetâ€??? Things were far from â€œsetâ€, and still are, and wonâ€™t be until Iâ€™m in the ground.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s the process. Life is a process. There isnâ€™t an â€œstopping pointâ€, or â€œendâ€ to it while youâ€™re living. If it isnâ€™t changing, youâ€™re dead. Things will always change, and you have to decide how to change (or not) along with them.</p>
