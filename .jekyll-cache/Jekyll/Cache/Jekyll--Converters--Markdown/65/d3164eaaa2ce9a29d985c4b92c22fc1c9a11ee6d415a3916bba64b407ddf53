I"0<p><a href="https://anchor.fm/mikelady91">Sometimes I publish podcasts</a>. I talk about creating value and the interplay between my training and professional life. I talk about how I get nerdy about being an athlete and how I use an athlete’s work ethic in becoming a better nerd. Producing this podcast helps me document, review, and reflect on what happens in my daily life.</p>

<p>“Life” happens at the daily level. It sounds simple, but what you do every day largely determines how you fare in the future. That’s why I choose to wake up early and train, and be thoughtful and introspective about it by recording this podcast. This way, I can squeeze the most juice out of every day.</p>
