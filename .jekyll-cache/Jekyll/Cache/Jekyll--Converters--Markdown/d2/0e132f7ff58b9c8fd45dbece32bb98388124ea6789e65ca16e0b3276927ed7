I"ß<p>I enjoy having conversations with my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ladyistheman/">brother</a> about two of his main passions in life: basketball and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends">League of Legends</a>. I love seeing him light up when he explains the latest League of Legends news or breaks down a basketball play. He has incredible domain expertise since he has played at a relative high level in each. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6fijiuQDx0">He started</a> <a href="#1">(1)</a> on the varsity basketball team in High School in both his junior and senior years, and at his peak, he achieved Diamond I ranking (0.06% of players hold this rank at any one time) in League of Legends.</p>
