I"0<p>As all “non-essential” businesses closed around the country mid-March 2020, there were many unanticipated knock-on effects. The effects that hit most close to home was: 1. the jiu-jitsu gyms I train at closing, and one closing a location permanently, and 2. the mainstream weight lifting gyms closed as well. This left many out in the cold without a place to exercise or equipment to train with. I was fortunate enough to already have a small home gym already started with dumbbells, kettlebells, and a pull up bar. As I started having to rely on my home gym as my sole source of exercise, I looked into purchasing more equipment for it. I was looking for some mid-weight dumbbells, 55 - 70 lbs. What I found was a volatile retail marketplace and secondary market not unlike the stock market at the time.</p>
