<a href="https://anchor.fm/mikelady">Sometimes I publish podcasts</a>. I talk about creating value and the interplay between my training and professional life. I talk about how I get nerdy about being an athlete and how I use an athlete's work ethic in becoming a better nerd. Producing this podcast helps me document, review, and reflect on what happens in my life. 

"Life" happens at the daily level. It sounds simple, but what you do every day largely determines your future. That's why I choose to wake up early and train, and be thoughtful by recording this podcast. This way, I can give and get the most value out of every day.
